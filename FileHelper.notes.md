# Notes for FileHelper.java

## Background

Since files associated with a given piece of ASCII art need to go into particular directories (see these [notes](./directory.structure.and.file.notes.md)), it makes sense to have a class help you with this.

## What's provided to you already

- method `public ArrayList<String> availableArtFiles()`
  - this method returns the names of all ASCII art files in the **ascii-art-files** directory
  - you will want to use this in **ArtiiApp** to help you with menu option 3 (loading a new art file)

## What you need to complete

There are a number of methods marked TODO - you need to complete each one. (Please remove the TODO when you have completed the method.)

If you need to create any helper methods, they should be declared **private** and **non-static**.
