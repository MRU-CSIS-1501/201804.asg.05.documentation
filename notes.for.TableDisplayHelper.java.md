# Notes for TableDisplayHelper.java

## Background

The table that you see displaying the unique characters is created with the help of this class.

## What's provided to you already

There's only one method that you can use in this class:

- `static String tableFrom(ArrayList<Character> entries)`
  - because this is static, remember you have to call it a certain way....

## What you need to complete

This sucker is DONE. You don't need to add anything here.
