# Assignment 05

## Challenge: Ascii Art PNG Generator

### Preamble

This assignment assumes you know just a bit about the following things:

- ASCII art
- pixels
- hex color codes

If you don't, don't panic - you only need a superficial knowledge of these things to do this assignment and a few minutes of Googling is all you need to get up to speed. Here are some suggested resources to help you:

- ASCII art: https://asciiart.website/index.php
- pixels: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf3_ZW2pJhk
- hex color codes: https://youtu.be/6cJd7eyYBFs?t=188

Although not 100% necessary, in order to enjoy the visual nature of this assignment, you will want to make sure that if you are working from home or on a laptop, that you have an FTP program installed. (FTP stands for _file transfer protocol_ and an FTP program is used to transfer files between a remote machine - like INS - and another machine - like your laptop.)

In the labs, we use FileZilla, so I'd suggest installing it on your own machine, as it is available for free for both Mac and Windows platforms. You can look at the FileZilla document in this assignment for further information on using the software.

### What you're going to build

The goal of this assignment is to create an application that has the following 3 features:

1. it allows a user to open an ASCII art file
1. it displays useful information about an opened ASCII art file
1. it allows the user to export an opened ASCII art file as a PNG image file

You will be creating a number of different classes to accomplish this. Since we would like to follow good object-oriented programming practices, each class will have a specific job - we want to avoid creating one huge class that does everything. The classes you will be creating are as follows:

- AsciiArt: represents ASCII art images
- AsciiToPngConverter: used to convert an AsciiArt object to a PNG image file
- CharToColorMap: used to map ASCII characters to hex colors
- ArtiiApp: the app itself, handling interaction with the user

Let's see the application in action.

**Example Run 1:**

<pre>
Welcome to ArtiiApp!

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> After starting the app, you can see the following things:
>
> - a welcome message (you can make this look however you like)
> - the default ASCII art image, along with some details about the image:
>   - the name of the file (_default_ in this case)
>   - the number of unique characters used in the art, along with a table showing those characters - note that the space is represented with this funky symbol: **␣**
>   - the total number of characters in the file
>   - the width (in characters) of the row with the most characters in it
>   - the height (in number of rows) of the file
> - a menu that gives you 4 choices. Your menu must have the same choices in the same order.
> - a prompt ('Choice? ')
>
> In this particular example, we see that the user chose to quit and was given a parting message. You can change the message, but there should be one.

> In this sample, we again load a new ascii art file (bat) - but this time, there is no warning about no color map being available. This is because I've placed a color map file in the ascii-art-directory that the program uses to map each character to a certain color.

> We then choose to save the ascii art as a PNG image. This creates the file **bat.png** in the **generated-png-files** directory. The file looks like this: ![Screenshot](images/bat.png)
>
> Finally, we choose to save the ascii art as a hex color file. This creates the file **bat.hex** in the **generated-hexcolor-files** directory. You can look at the file [here](images/bat.hex).
